	<em><span style="color: rgb(0, 51, 102); ">This is a miscellany of stories told by Sri Chinmoy over the years about his childhood in Chittagong. When he used to reminisce about his Indian life, he would pluck anecdotes from here and there, not necessarily in any chronological order. Sometimes he would follow a theme, or relate events connected with a certain relative. Oftentimes, in answer to a question from one of his students, he would invoke an episode from his youth, and then the whole atmosphere of his Indian village life would permeate him. A kind of magic would descend as wave after wave of sweet memories flooded his being. Here are just a few of those well-loved stories. It is perhaps worth noting that while these stories are often in the present tense, they were mostly told during the 1990’s.</span></em></p>

					We Indians, specially Bengalis, are always proud of our birthplace, whether we think of our province, town or even village. Strangely enough, as a villager, you are even more proud of where you were born than you would be if you were born in a large town or city.</p>
<p align="justify">
					Always when I think of Shakpura, I feel so lucky that I was born in a village, not in a town. Then, when I think of Chittagong, I feel so lucky that I was born in Chittagong and not somewhere else in East Bengal. Then, when I think of East Bengal, I feel so lucky that I was born there and not in West Bengal or somewhere else.</p>
<p align="justify">
					We always feel that our village is by far the best; our town is by far the best; our city is by far the best; our province is by far the best; our country is by far the best. That is our national feeling. By widening and widening our vision, we can go from nationalism to internationalism. But if I do not have real and genuine love for my village, Shakpura, then I can never develop love for Chittagong, and if I cannot develop love for Chittagong, I can never have love for Bengal. If I do not love Bengal, I will never have love for India and if I do not have true love for India, I will never be able to love America or any other part of the world, let alone the whole world.</p>
<p align="justify">
					It is because we love our mother right from the dawn of our life that we can love others. From the physical mother, we expand and increase our love so that eventually we feel utmost love for the Universal Mother.</p>

					When I think of the affection of my cousins, I simply cannot imagine that they are not my real brothers and sisters. We were brought up together. They are absolutely like my real brothers and sisters.</p>
<p align="justify">
					My cousin Pushpita and her mother, my aunt, both live in the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. They are so close to our family. Once my sister Lily had a difference of opinion with my cousin about something and for fifteen years they would not talk to each other. Here we are like brothers and sisters and two members of the family are not on speaking terms! It was so painful for the rest of the family. Everybody else continued to mix as before, but blindly I took my sister’s side. Who knows who was right and who was wrong? For me, whatever side my sister was on was the only side for me.</p>
<p align="justify">
					So this sad state went on, went on. Finally, a few years ago, when my sister Lily fell seriously ill, my cousin and her mother came to see her in the Nursing Home. They said, “No, we are not going to go away. The past is dust. This is the time for us to be with you.” Then my sister Lily had to surrender and they became extremely close once more.</p>
<p align="justify">
					My aunt is 99½ years old. Next year, in March, she will reach 100. She will be the first person in our family to reach 100. A few years ago, I told her that I wanted her to live to 100 and she has done it. I am so proud of my aunt. She is my mother’s younger sister. Alas, my mother did not even live to be fifty years old. She passed away when she was 49.</p>

					In our family, my father worshipped Kali and my mother worshipped Durga. We did not care so much for Saraswati. Once a year, we observed Saraswati Puja, but otherwise it was all Kali and Durga.</p>
<p align="justify">
					Again, in order to pass your school examinations, you have to worship Saraswati because she is the goddess of knowledge, wisdom and perfection. If she is pleased with you, then she will grant you the capacity to learn things by rote very quickly. So when I was a young boy, I used to repeat millions of times, like a parrot, the Sanskrit slokas to invoke Saraswati. Mine was absolutely Bengali pronunciation. How fast I used to say the words, like a train! Only the sound I used to hear and with my devotional spirit I invoked Saraswati, but the words I did not pronounce correctly at all.</p>
<p align="justify">
					But Saraswati was pleased with my prayer and she blessed me with retentive faculties. In the school, I always used to stand first. When I was fourteen years old, I was meditating in the main building of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram and she appeared right before my eyes. She was playing on her celestial vina. I had never heard this instrument before, either in Chittagong or in Pondicherry. Then she broke the whole instrument into millions of pieces and she poured them into me. She said, “I am giving you my knowledge.”</p>
<p align="justify">
					Now look at this! When I worshipped Saraswati as a young boy, how fast I said her name. If a teacher wanted to give marks for my performance, he would not have given me even zero out of one hundred. It is absurdity. I am the worst possible student that I have ever seen! But divine compassion is unconditional. Because I did it in my childhood, she came to me when I was a youth. Does she care for my pronunciation? No, it is only the devotional attitude that she cares for. Unconditionally she poured and poured her knowledge, wisdom and intellectual aspect into me. That is why I have been able to write so many books. It is all because of the blessings that I received from Saraswati in 1945 or 1946.</p>

					When I was only nine or ten years old, my father told me a story about astral journeys. I knew that my father never told lies, but when I heard this story, I thought that perhaps my father was only joking. I could not believe that it really happened.</p>
<p align="justify">
					My father told me that once a judge happened to be trying a case in court. All on a sudden, a Buddhist monk came into the courtroom while the court was in session. He walked right up to the judge and said, “Meditate, meditate.”</p>
<p align="justify">
					The judge was puzzled. Then the Buddhist monk said, “You do not know why? Then I shall tell you. You know that your wife is now in London. This is a most significant moment. Take down the time. Now calculate the time difference between here and London. At this moment, your wife is giving birth to a most beautiful child.”</p>
<p align="justify">
					To the judge’s wide surprise, eight hours later he received a telegram from London. The telegram came with the happiest news that a child had been born. And the time of birth corresponded exactly with the appearance of the Buddhist monk.</p>
<p align="justify">
					Six months later, the Buddhist monk again went to the court. This time he said to the judge, “Your wife has now returned to India. I would like to see her.” The judge was extremely pleased with the monk, so he took him to see his wife. Upon seeing the monk, the wife exclaimed, “Oh, I have seen this man before. He came to me at the hospital in London.”</p>
<p align="justify">
					That was my father’s story. Then he explained to me that it was the subtle physical of the Buddhist monk that had gone to the hospital in London, while the monk himself remained in India. Unfortunately, I did not believe this story at all. I thought that perhaps the monk had somehow gotten the telegram from somewhere else. I gave my father all kinds of silly arguments.</p>
<p align="justify">
					Many years later, I came to know from my own personal experience that this kind of astral journey is quite possible for spiritual Masters and aspirants of a very high order.</p>

					In 1986, I returned to Shakpura for the first time in over forty years. Our original four or five houses disappeared during a cyclone after we had gone to the Ashram. They were blown away. Afterwards, our relatives tried, according to their financial capacity, to rebuild the main house where I was born, but it is not the same. In size and proportion, it is totally different. They have kept the same main structure, but the roof is now very low. There used to be a second floor with a corrugated tin roof, but now there is no upstairs. Also the doorways were much higher, otherwise my brother Mantu would not have been able to pass through the door. Unfortunately, now it looks poverty-stricken.</p>
<p align="justify">
					Upstairs my three sisters and my cousin used to live. Chitta, Mantu and I used to sleep on the ground floor. On the left side of the house was our temple. It is no longer there. Now there is only a haystack. There was also a guesthouse on the kitchen side, but it, too, has disappeared, along with the servants’ quarters and other houses.</p>
<p align="justify">
					Right in front of the house were many mango trees, at least twenty. Now there is not even one. My relatives said they had to use them to get money. It is like a barren desert. In the back of the house there were ponds. The largest one has been reduced in size so that the gardens can be utilised as paddy fields. In this pond, I learnt to swim. I used to sit on the stone slab that was the front doorstep and Brahmins used to come and chant for protection and invoke the presence of Lord Krishna.</p>

But my mother’s soul in Heaven was dead against it, so I cannot stand against my mother. My sister and brothers begged me to send money to our relatives for this purpose. I was quite happy to do so, but unless my mother changes her mind, I cannot do anything. I wanted to have a memorial for my parents, but my mother has her own reasons for not wanting it.</p>

How I would like to have copies of those books!</p>
<p align="justify">
					Bengali is very soft and sweet, whereas our Chittagong dialect is uneven. The whole thing in the Chittagong dialect is to speak very fast.

					If you want to write the Chittagong dialect down, you have to use the real Bengali characters and then add some diphthongs here and there.

					I wish to tell you something amusing but authentic. As a child, I was very fond of monkeys. That is why I still have the monkey consciousness in me! I had two or three monkeys at a time. My most favourite monkey used to bite me like anything. I used to give it bananas and other kinds of food that I liked to eat. Right after eating the banana, he used to bite me. You have no idea, how many marks I have even now from monkey bites.</p>
<p align="justify">
					One day my mother said to me, “Monkeys do not bite little babies, because they are so innocent and helpless. But when children become a little older, like you, then you become immediate victims to monkeys. But there is one thing you can try to save yourself: you can fall down and pretend that you are dead.”</p>
<p align="justify">
					It seems that monkeys do not bite dead people. My monkeys had a long chain around their necks. As soon as I came within their reach, I used to fall on the ground and hold my breath. This I have done forty or fifty times. Then the monkey would feel me to see if I am really dead, but he would not bite me. Usually I escaped, but two or three times I was caught because the distance between us was not very great when I fell down.</p>
<p align="justify">
					Of course, the moment I used to open my eyes and get up, the monkey would bite me anyway! I did not have the heart to strike the monkey, but my cousins used to strike them so hard and then the monkeys would leave them alone.</p>

					There is a philosophical lesson to be learnt from this. Let us say that in this case to be dead means to be deep in ignorance-sea, which is full of impurity. At that time, the lower vital forces do not bother you because they know you are at their beck and call. But the moment your soul awakens you and makes you aspire for purity, these lower vital forces say, “Where are you going?” At that time, they challenge you. If you want to live a spiritual life, then you must fight against ignorance and establish purity. But if you want to surrender to ignorance, you will just lie down. Then incarnation will follow incarnation and you will not make any progress at all.</p>

					I went back to Chittagong after more than forty years to see my birthplace. I wanted to see where I was once upon a time when I was still a tiny grain of sand. I just wanted to appreciate the finite in me, which was absolutely insignificant. Whoever thought that a little Indian village boy would come to the West and write so many books and songs and so on?</p>
<p align="justify">
					I know that I cannot utilise the past realities in my life in order to make progress, so in one sense my visit was useless. But curiosity took me there. On the one hand, it was useless, but, on the other hand, you can say that there is always a source from whence we grow. A vast expanse of light begins with just a tiny flame. Again, the source of that tiny flame is infinite Light. In the process of involution, infinite Light is descending, descending, descending.</p>
<p align="justify">
					So I wanted to go back to see my source. And still, when I think of my little village – East Shakpura – it gives me a kind of inner thrill.</p>

					Lakshmi is worshipped practically all over India in various ways. Each town, city and province worships her in its own way. Mother Lakshmi is for everybody, good or bad. She is the Mother of indulgence.</p>

					While I was growing up, our family and neighbours in Shakpura observed Mother Lakshmi’s Puja in a special way. On this one day of the year, you can steal things from your neighbours. The gardens are full of flowers and fruits, plus there are various other things in the courtyards of the houses. So you can enter and steal whatever you like. Even if you are caught red-handed by the owner, you just smile and go away. Expensive things that are kept inside the house are not available, but anything that is left outside you have the opportunity to take away as your own.</p>
<p align="justify">
					So we would go to other people’s houses and steal mangoes and other things, and they would come to our house and steal things. It was all great fun.</p>

					There are quite a few places in India whose very name gives me tremendous joy and a tremendous inner thrill. Kanyakumari is one of those. Kanyakumari is where Vivekananda entered into the water and Sri Ramakrishna was telling him inwardly to come to America. No matter how many times during the day I hear ‘Kanyakumari’, the name gives me the same inner thrill.</p>
<p align="justify">
					Another place that gives me immense joy is Cherrapunjee in Assam.

					Another name that used to give me special joy when I was a little boy is ‘Pondicherry’. Even without the Ashram, the very word ‘Pondicherry’ was like Heaven for me.</p>
<p align="justify">
					There are quite a few rivers in India. When it is a matter of sacred feeling, nothing compares with the Ganges. But, strangely enough, I get more joy when I hear the name of the Jamuna River, even though it is so small. Perhaps it is because of its special connection with Lord Krishna.</p>
<p align="justify">
					When we travelled by train along the route from Calcutta to Madras, we passed over the Godavari River. O God, such a sacred feeling I used to get whenever the train passed over that river!</p>
<p align="justify">
					Then comes our Taj Mahal. I have been there three times. When you look at the Taj Mahal with the mind, the mind immediately gets lost because of the beauty and power of the place. How many pilgrims and other people have been there to see the Taj Mahal! It shows an emperor’s love for his wife. Because of Shah Jahan’s love for his wife, Mumtaz, he built something immortal.</p>
<p align="justify">
					But of all the places in India, what gives me utmost joy is the name ‘Chittagong’ and specially ‘Shakpura’. On the one hand, I am a cosmopolitan. I am a spiritual man; I am meant for the whole world. But still, when I hear the name ‘Shakpura’ or ‘Chittagong’, immediately my heart derives the sweetest joy. Vastness we appreciate, admire and adore. But inside littleness, we can develop sweetness, fondness and intimacy. For me, that sweetness can be found inside the mere mention of my childhood village home.</p>
